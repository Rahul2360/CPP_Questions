/*Write a C++ program to create a class called MATRIX using a two dimensional array of
integers.Implement the following operations by overloading the operator == which
checks the compatibility of the two matrices to be added and subtracted. Perform the
addition and subtraction by overloading the operators + and ‚Äê respectively. Display the
results by overloading operator <<.
Sample Input
2 //number of rows
2 //number of columns
2 3
4 5
2 // no of rows of second matrix
2 //no of column of second matrix
7 8
9 10
Sample Output
Addition of matrices
the result is
9 11
13 15
subtraction of matrices
The result is
-5 -5
-5 -5*/
